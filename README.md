# EV_Charging_Prediction
This repository predicts the duration and energy demand of residential EV charging sessions using real-world data from 267 vehicles. It highlights user behavior heterogeneity, improving prediction accuracy for overnight charging sessions (MAPE reduced from 200% to 15%) to optimize smart charging systems for grid efficiency and user needs.
